This was our fourth year playing the cloud village CTF and it was as fun as always. One of the new things added this year was a dynamic point system. This means that the first team to solve a problem gets the full points, the second team gets slightly less, and so on. It allows for a more strategic approach where it can be worth having some teammates jump to higher point challenges that will take longer early on.

We placed **5th** this year, closely behind 3rd/4th while the first place team absolutely dominated.

## What is Cloud Village

(copy/pasta from [2022 writeups](/cloud-village-2022))

[Cloud village](https://cloud-village.org/) is a village at Defcon self described as:

>Cloud Village is an open space to meet folks interested in offensive and defensive aspects of cloud security.

`Jeopordy style` means the CTF solutions are submitted in standardized `flags`. For cloudvillage, the format was `FLAG-{ANY_32_CHARS_HERE}`; for example:
 `FLAG-{abcdefghijklemnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890}`

## Writeups

We completed ~15 flags IIRC. We don't have enough info/memory for all of these, so feel free to reach out if you have more.
