## What is Defcon

Before getting into the writeups it's worth quickly going over the infamous Defcon. Defcon is a meetup/conference for hackers and tinkerers from around the world to meetup with like minded people. There is a wide range of subsections and interests in Defcon itself organized around "villages".

A few villages include:
- Car hacking village
- Packet hacking village
- Voting machine hacking village
- Cloud village
- Lockpick village
- many, many more

### What is Cloud Village

[Cloud village](https://cloud-village.org/) is a village at Defcon self described as:

>Cloud Village is an open space to meet folks interested in offensive and defensive aspects of cloud security.

They have provided Jeopory style CTF (capture the flag) competitions that I (and friends) have competed in as a team the past couple of years. We actually won the Defcon 29 Cloud Village CTF and were looking to play again. Cloud Village CTF prompts are generally **extremely** broad and often have red herrings. Further, Cloud Village questions are generally more than one step, meaning the first clue you find generally leads to another and so on.

`Jeopordy style` means the CTF solutions are submitted in standardized `flags`. For cloudvillage, the format was `FLAG-{ANY_32_CHARS_HERE}`; for example:
 `FLAG-{abcdefghijklemnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890}`
