## Overview

Cyber Apocalypse is a Capture The Flag (CTF) hosted by [Hack The Box](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/event/details/cyber-apocalypse-2024-hacker-royale-after-party-1470) yearly. It covers a typical large variety of Jeopardy format flags over categories like:

- Forensics
- Web
- Cryptography
- Blockchain
- Hardware
- Misc

Each event is ranked with different difficulty levels from `very easy` to `insane` with varying points. The points available decrease as more people solve the challenge so it is in your best interest to solve them faster.

The event was five days long.
